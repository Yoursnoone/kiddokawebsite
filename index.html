									<p>Well this was the first time she had sent me something regarding an unofficial group invite ! And then we were casually just reokying on unofficial group and one day (this is before we became best friends) in general to just oull her leg i sent her a sticker which was quite embarrassing (IDHAD BHI AAJAO JANEMAN) and after that a slapping reply dropped on group chat then boom ! my fear shot up and i went a literal scaredy cat ! 😂🤣
										and after that i saved her number later we just started sharing notes and asking doubts with each other well on whatsApp it was just the casual one !
										After this happened there have been nothing we wouldn't have done together be it tests, exams, assignments, projects, quizes, long and deep chats,
										what not I am indebted to you kiddo, You Have been a real best friend of mine as always and no matter what you'll always have my back,
										this is something i promise myself, no matter if we fight and get drifted apart anything that makes you a good person, a good daughter and a good best friend i'm ready for everything you'd ask me to do !
										i just wish every ounce of energy to support you to fulfill your dreams and achieve all the ambitions you've always dreamt off !
										And make your parents proud ! I will support you by all the means possible and will try to do the impossible no matter what the odds are !

										but as we were in the Lab premises we couldn't do any such thing but it's okay ! and the funniest part of that day was farhaan made us meet like Sahil this is Khushi, Khushi this is Sahil 
										deep down we were like "Bata bhi kise raha hai ?" 😂🤣

										And then patching up like small kids and then carrying on with the event ! Well that was the first day when we both danced for the first time and laughed at it soo much !
										Uhh every small details still feels that it is currently happening, I just have no Words to speak about all these !
